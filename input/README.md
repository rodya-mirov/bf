I did not write any of these programs. It seems like a lot of effort, honestly.

I got the good ones from https://github.com/pretzelhammer/brainfuck_compilers/tree/master/input
which was released under this license: https://github.com/pretzelhammer/brainfuck_compilers/blob/master/license-apache
which is fine.

I might add some of my own tests later?
